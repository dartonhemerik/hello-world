# hello-world

Hello everyone,
My name is Darton Hemerik, a 29 year forever living in sunny California, and I want to be a front-end developer. I’ve spent the better part of the past decade working in the restaurant and retail industry. As well spending a lot of time in school trying to figure out what I want to do in life. I originally wanted to get into the health industry and unfortunately realized much later on it wasn’t for me; however, I was so close to graduating I persevered on. I cannot believe its taken me this long to realize that I’d rather work in the tech field considering how much time I spend on a computer. It should have been a no-brainer, but at least I’m making moves now.

So here we are in 2020! It’s been interesting to say the least, which I can assure everyone can relate. Though it’s a new decade to make my own. Enrolling at Long Beach City College has been a fantastic experience so far. I can already tell its put me in a much better headspace. Even when projects give me trouble the process of learning something new and exciting has been fun. That is why I’m proudly displaying my progress on the right and I cannot wait to further myself into the field.
